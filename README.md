# Projects

- [**Cars Sales Prediction**](https://github.com/khaganshu/Cars_Sales_ML_Project)

This project is a machine learning model that predicts the price of a car based on its features. The model is trained on a dataset of car sales and uses a best regression model using GridSearchCV to predict the price of a car.

- [**Airline Satisfaction Prediction**](https://github.com/khaganshu/Airline_Satisfaction_Classification_Project)

This project is a machine learning model that predicts whether an airline customer is satisfied with their service based on their features. The model is trained on a dataset of customer satisfaction and uses a best classification model using GridSearchCV to predict whether a customer is satisfied or not.

- [**UTKFace Classification**](https://github.com/khaganshu/UTKFace_Classification_Project)

This project is a machine learning model that predicts the age, gender, and ethnicity of a face based on its features. The model is trained on a dataset of UTKFace and uses a CNN model to predict the age, gender, and ethnicity of a face.
